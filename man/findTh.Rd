\title{Find calibration thresholds}

\description{
The purpose of this function is to automatically find calibration thresholds
for a numerical causal condition, to be split into separate groups.
}

\usage{
findTh(x, n = 1, hclustm = "complete", distm = "euclidean", ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A numerical causal condition.}
  \item{n}{The number of thresholds to find.}
  \item{hclustm}{The agglomeration (clustering) method to be used.}
  \item{distm}{The distance measure to be used.}
  \item{...}{Other arguments (mainly for backwards compatibility).}
}

\details{
The process of calibration into crisp sets assumes expert knowledge about the
best threshold(s) which separates the raw data into the most meaningful
groups.

In the absence of such knowledge, an automatic procedure might help grouping
the raw data according to statistical clustering techniques.

The number of groups to split depends on the number of thresholds: one
thresholds splits into two groups, two thresholds splits into three groups etc.

Previous versions of this function had an argument named \bold{\code{groups}} instead
of argument \bold{\code{n}}, but they are bacwards compatible.

For more details about how many groups can be formed with how many thresholds,
see \code{?cutree}.

More details about the clustering techniques used in this function are found
using \code{?hclust}, and also more details about different distance measures
can be found with \code{?dist}. This function uses their default values.
