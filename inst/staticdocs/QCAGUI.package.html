QCAGUI: A Package for Qualitative Comparative Analysis, with a Graphical User Interface

      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>The package <b><span class = "pkg">QCAGUI</span></b> continues the development of the <b><span class = "pkg">QCA</span></b> package and
complements it with a graphical user interface. Both packages are needed (they depend
on each other) to have a complete functionality. Loading either package will
automatically load the other.</p>
  
      <p>The tandem of packages <span class = "pkg">QCA</span> and <span class = "pkg">QCAGUI</span> implements the comparative method as
first described by Ragin (1987), and extended by Cronqvist and Berg-Schlosser (2009)
and Ragin (2000, 2008). QCA is a bridge between the qualitative and quantitative
research methodologies, making use of the qualitative procedures in a systematic,
algorithmic way (therefore increasing the &#147;confidence&#148; in the results, as
understood by quantitative researchers).</p>
  
      <p>The Quine-McCluskey minimization algorithm implemented in this package is
mathematically exact, as described by Dusa (2007), Dusa (2010) and Dusa and Thiem (2015).
It returns the relevant prime implicants for both <dfn>csQCA</dfn> (binary crisp sets QCA)
and also for <dfn>mvQCA</dfn> (multi-value QCA, as of version 0.6-0).</p>
  
      <p>Starting with version 0.4-5 the package <span class = "pkg">QCA</span> gained a new function called
<code><a href='eqmcc.html'>eqmcc</a></code> (from <dfn>"e"nhanced Quine-McCluskey</dfn>) that finds exact solutions
with a substantially lower memory consumption.</p>
  
      <p>Since version 1.0-0, the package <b><span class = "pkg">QCA</span></b> welcomed a second co-author Alrik Thiem
(up to version 1.1-3), responsible with the manual testing and documentation of
functions, while Adrian Dusa was responsible with all of the software development.
The package gained new functionality by employing <dfn>fsQCA</dfn> (fuzzy-set QCA) and also
other types of QCA like <dfn>tsQCA</dfn> (temporal QCA), see Caren and Panofsky (2005),
Ragin and Strand (2008). The package is also able to obtain the causal chains similar
to those from the package <b><span class = "pkg">cna</span></b> (see Ambuehl et all 2015).</p>
  
      <p>The results of the <b><span class = "pkg">QCAGUI</span></b> package are very consistent with (and sometimes even
better than) the results of the other software packages for QCA, most notably
<b><span class = "pkg">fs/QCA</span></b> by Ragin and Davey (2014) and <b><span class = "pkg">Tosmana</span></b> by Cronqvist and
Berg-Schlosser (2009). A comparison of several such software is provided by Thiem and
Dusa (2013), noting that all description for package <b><span class = "pkg">QCA</span></b> is also valid for
package <b><span class = "pkg">QCAGUI</span></b>.</p>
  
      <p>Versions after 1.9-6 (when the user interface was based on the package <b><span class = "pkg">Rcmdr</span></b>),
use a new graphical user interface based on the package <b><span class = "pkg">shiny</span></b>. In order to avoid
developing different interfaces for different operating systems, the current GUI was
designed to work into a webpage. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery for the user
interface, a custom development framework using vector graphics based on the Raphael
library, and extensive Javascript code to bind these altogether. A first version of this
user interface was presented by Dusa (2007), but users should be aware the current version
is much more advanced.</p>
  
      <p>The author of this package is grateful for the effort of the former coauthor of the
<b><span class = "pkg">QCA</span></b> package, Alrik Thiem, given his responsibilities of testing and documenting
the functions. Although the current documentation is completely re-written, it owes a
great deal of impact from the previous versions.</p>
